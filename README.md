# Serpent's Hand (SCP: SL LabApi)
Serpent's Hand for SCP: SL using LabApi

**Installation**
Simply put the dll in the LabApi plugins 9095 or global folder. It will automatically add the configs.

**Information**
Serpents Hand can not damage the SCP's and the SCP's can't damage them. SCP-096 and SCP-173 won't be triggered by Serpents.
Currently, Serpents Hand only works with the SCP's and does not help the d-class or any other class.

***THEY CURRENTLY CAN'T SPAWN NORMALLY***
I plan to make them spawn in the next update with some configurable files.
